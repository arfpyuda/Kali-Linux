Install zsh in kali linux :

    apt-get install zshrc
    sudo apt install -y zsh zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions
    cp /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/
    
then all you need to do switch " ZSH "
    
    root@arfpyuda :~ zsh
    
you can set ZSH as your default (replacing bash) by doing
    
    chsh -s /bin/zsh
    
    done
